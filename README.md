## Overview
KlinItAll is a modular, production-ready, and extensible data preprocessing system designed to **clean, prepare, and analyze structured datasets** including numeric, categorical, text, date-time, and geospatial data for machine learning and analytics.  

Built with Streamlit, KlinItAll integrates **AI-powered narratives**, interactive visualizations, and a **context-aware chatbot** to provide real-time insights, recommendations, and guidance during the preprocessing workflow.

---

## Purpose of the System
KlinItAll addresses the common challenge in data science: **50‚Äì80% of project time is consumed by data cleaning, formatting, and preprocessing**. This system automates repetitive tasks while providing intelligent guidance, enabling analysts to focus on **insight generation, modeling, and decision-making**.
